# Leveraging-Diacritics-A-Deep-Learning-Approach-for-Enhanced-Sentiment-Analysis-in-Arabic-Language.
Repository Name: Arabic-Sentiment-Analysis-RNN
Description
This repository hosts the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on sentiment analysis of diacritized Arabic text using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly leveraging the MARBERT model. The project aims to explore and enhance the capabilities of RNNs in handling the complex morphology of the Arabic language, which is enriched with diacritical marks. The codebase includes preprocessing scripts, model training and evaluation modules, and utilities for handling diacritized Arabic text.

Here's a detailed README.md file template for your GitHub repository that covers the sentiment analysis of diacritized Arabic text using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically focusing on the MARBERT model:

# Arabic Sentiment Analysis with RNNs

This repository contains the implementation of a sentiment analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) tailored to handle diacritized Arabic text. The primary focus is on leveraging the MARBERT model to enhance the processing of Arabic's complex morphology and diacritical nuances.

## Project Description

Sentiment analysis of Arabic text presents unique challenges due to its rich morphology and the use of diacritics that influence the meanings of words. This project aims to develop and evaluate RNN models that effectively address these challenges, providing more accurate sentiment analysis compared to traditional methods.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalize and prepare both diacritized and non-diacritized Arabic text for analysis.
- **Model Implementation:** Utilize MARBERT, a variant of RNN optimized for Arabic, to perform sentiment analysis.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Measure the effectiveness of the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Implement attention mechanisms and bidirectional processing to improve model performance on complex texts.

## Installation
